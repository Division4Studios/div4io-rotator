# Foundry VTT - Div4.io Rotator
This module for Foundry Virtual Tabletop enhances the user experience by providing a simple and intuitive way to rotate tokens and tiles within the game. 

## Features

With this module, you can select a token or multiple tokens, and by pressing the control key, the selected tokens will rotate to face towards the location of your mouse cursor. This allows for dynamic and quick adjustments of token orientation, enhancing the visual storytelling and strategic elements of your game.

The same functionality applies to tiles as well. Whether you're adjusting the angle of a wall or reorienting a piece of scenery, this module makes it easy to get your environment looking just right.

## How It Works

Once a token or tile is selected, press and hold the control key. As you move your mouse, the selected token or tile will rotate to face the cursor. This rotation is based on the center point of the token or tile, allowing for precise adjustments. 

Release the control key to stop the rotation. If you have multiple tokens or tiles selected, they will all rotate in sync, maintaining their relative orientations to each other.
